## Static vs Dynamic Websites: A Business Perspective

### Static Websites üìÑ

**What it means for BAs:**
A static website is like a digital brochure. Once created, the content doesn't change unless a developer manually updates it.

**Business Use Cases:**
- Company landing pages
- Marketing websites
- Documentation sites
- Simple portfolio sites

**Advantages for Business:**
- **Lower cost** - Cheaper to build and host
- **Faster loading** - Better user experience
- **More secure** - Fewer things can break
- **Easy hosting** - Can use simple, cheap hosting

**When to Recommend Static:**
- Content changes infrequently (monthly or less)
- No user accounts or login needed
- Simple contact forms are sufficient
- Budget is limited

### Dynamic Websites ‚ö°

**What it means for BAs:**
Dynamic websites can change content based on user interactions, database information, or real-time data.

**Business Use Cases:**
- E-commerce platforms
- Social media sites
- User dashboards
- Booking systems
- Any site with user accounts

**Advantages for Business:**
- **Personalization** - Show different content to different users
- **Real-time updates** - Content changes automatically
- **User interaction** - Comments, reviews, user profiles
- **Data collection** - Track user behavior and analytics

**When to Recommend Dynamic:**
- Users need accounts or personalized experience
- Content updates frequently (daily or hourly)
- E-commerce or booking functionality needed
- User-generated content required

## Key Questions for BAs to Ask

When gathering requirements, ask:

1. **"Will different users see different content?"**
   - If yes ‚Üí Dynamic likely needed

2. **"How often will content change?"**
   - Weekly/monthly ‚Üí Static might work
   - Daily/hourly ‚Üí Dynamic needed

3. **"Do users need to login or have accounts?"**
   - If yes ‚Üí Dynamic required

4. **"Will users create content (reviews, posts, etc.)?"**
   - If yes ‚Üí Dynamic required

5. **"What's the budget for hosting and maintenance?"**
   - Limited ‚Üí Consider static first

## Business Impact Example

**Scenario:** A restaurant wants a website

**Static Approach:**
- Menu, hours, contact info, photos
- Cost: $500-2000 to build, $10/month hosting
- Updates: Email developer for menu changes

**Dynamic Approach:**
- Online ordering, user accounts, real-time inventory
- Cost: $5000-20000 to build, $50-200/month hosting
- Updates: Restaurant staff can update through admin panel

**BA Recommendation:** Start with static for basic web presence, plan dynamic features for phase 2 if budget allows.

## Technical Terms BAs Should Know

- **Content Management System (CMS)**: Allows non-technical users to update content
- **Database**: Where dynamic content is stored
- **API**: How different systems talk to each other
