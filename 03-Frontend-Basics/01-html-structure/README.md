# üèóÔ∏è HTML Structure (For Business Analysts)

## What Is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of every website. For BAs, understanding HTML helps you:
- **Communicate better** with developers about website structure
- **Write clearer requirements** for web features
- **Understand complexity** of different page layouts
- **Review wireframes** with technical context

## HTML in Business Terms

Think of HTML like the **blueprint of a building**:
- **Foundation** - Basic page structure
- **Rooms** - Different content sections
- **Labels** - Headings, titles, descriptions
- **Connections** - Links between pages
- **Instructions** - Forms, buttons, interactive elements

## Key HTML Concepts for BAs

### 1. Page Structure
**What developers create:**
- **Header** - Top section with navigation and branding
- **Main content** - Primary information users came to see
- **Sidebar** - Secondary information or navigation
- **Footer** - Bottom section with links and legal info

**BA perspective:** Like organizing a document with clear sections that users expect to find.

### 2. Content Hierarchy
**Heading levels** organize information like an outline:
- **Main title** - Most important topic (like a book title)
- **Section headings** - Major topics (like chapter titles)
- **Subsection headings** - Specific topics (like section titles)
- **Body text** - Detailed information

**Business impact:** Good hierarchy improves user experience and search engine visibility.

### 3. Interactive Elements
**Forms** collect user information:
- **Text fields** - Name, email, addresses
- **Dropdowns** - State selection, product categories
- **Checkboxes** - Multiple selections (interests, permissions)
- **Buttons** - Submit forms, trigger actions

**BA consideration:** Each form field affects user experience and conversion rates.

## HTML Simple Example

Here's what a basic business page structure looks like:

```html
<header>
  <h1>Company Name</h1>
  <nav>Home | Products | Contact</nav>
</header>

<main>
  <h2>Welcome to Our Business</h2>
  <p>We provide excellent solutions...</p>
</main>

<footer>
  <p>¬© 2024 Company Name</p>
</footer>
```

**BA translation:** This creates a professional page with clear branding, navigation, main message, and legal footer.
