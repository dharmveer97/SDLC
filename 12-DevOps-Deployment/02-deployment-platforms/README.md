## Deployment Platforms: Business Infrastructure Decisions

### What are Deployment Platforms for Business?

**Think of deployment platforms like real estate for your digital business:**

**Traditional Hosting (Dedicated Servers):**

- Like buying and maintaining your own office building
- High upfront costs, full control, responsible for everything
- Fixed capacity regardless of actual usage

**Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud):**

- Like renting flexible office space in a business center
- Pay for what you use, shared infrastructure
- Can scale up or down based on business needs

**Platform-as-a-Service (Netlify, Vercel, Heroku):**

- Like renting a fully-serviced office with IT support included
- Higher per-unit cost but includes management and support
- Focus on business, not infrastructure management

### Business Value of Platform Selection

**Strategic Considerations:**

- **Cost Predictability**: Fixed vs. variable pricing models
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle business growth
- **Time-to-Market**: How quickly can you launch?

## Business Continuity and Risk Management

### Vendor Risk Assessment

**Platform Stability Questions:**

1. How long has the platform been in business?
2. What's their financial stability and growth trajectory?
3. What's their track record for uptime and reliability?
4. How easy is it to migrate away if needed?

**Compliance and Security:**

1. Do they meet your industry compliance requirements?
2. What security certifications do they have?
3. How do they handle data protection and privacy?
4. What's their incident response and communication process?

### Migration Strategy

**Exit Planning:**

- Always maintain ability to export your data and code
- Document deployment processes for reproducibility
- Consider multi-cloud strategies for critical applications
- Plan migration costs and timeline (typically 20-40% of original setup cost)

**Risk Mitigation:**

- Use infrastructure-as-code for reproducible deployments
- Maintain staging environments that mirror production
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing
- Monitor vendor health and have backup platform identified
