# üîç What Is Git? (For Business Analysts)

## Why BAs Need to Understand Git

As a Business Analyst, understanding Git helps you:

- **Track requirements changes** throughout the project
- **Communicate better** with development teams
- **Understand why** some changes take longer than others
- **Monitor project progress** more effectively

## Git in Simple Terms

Think of Git like **"Track Changes" for code**, but much more powerful.

### Real-World Analogy: Document Collaboration

**Without Git (like sharing Word docs via email):**

- Sarah emails "Project_Plan_v1.docx" to the team
- Tom makes changes, saves as "Project_Plan_v2_Tom.docx"
- Lisa also changes v1, saves as "Project_Plan_Lisa_Changes.docx"
- Everyone is confused about which version is current
- Changes get lost or overwritten

**With Git (like a smart document system):**

- One master document that everyone can access
- Every change is tracked with who, what, and when
- Multiple people can work simultaneously without conflicts
- Complete history of all changes
- Easy to combine different people's work

## Key Concepts for BAs

### 1. Repository (Repo)

**What it is:** A project folder that tracks all changes
**BA perspective:** Like a project file that contains all documents, requirements, and history

### 2. Commit

**What it is:** A saved snapshot of changes with a description
**BA perspective:** Like saving a document version with notes about what changed

**Example commit messages:**

- "Add user login functionality"
- "Fix payment processing bug"
- "Update checkout flow based on BA requirements"

### 3. Branch

**What it is:** A parallel version for working on features
**BA perspective:** Like creating a copy of a document to try different approaches without affecting the original

### 4. Merge

**What it is:** Combining changes from different branches
**BA perspective:** Like accepting track changes and merging different document versions

## Git vs GitHub

### Git = The Tool

- Software that tracks changes
- Works on individual computers
- Like Microsoft Word (the application)

### GitHub = The Platform

- Online service that hosts Git repositories
- Enables team collaboration
- Like OneDrive or SharePoint (the sharing platform)

## Why Developers Use Git

### Problem Git Solves

1. **"Who changed what and when?"** - Complete audit trail
2. **"Can we undo this change?"** - Easy rollback
3. **"How do we work on the same code?"** - Collaboration without conflicts
4. **"Where's the latest version?"** - Single source of truth

### Business Benefits

- **Reduced errors** - Changes are tracked and reviewable
- **Faster delivery** - Teams can work in parallel
- **Better quality** - All changes are reviewed before going live
- **Compliance** - Complete audit trail for all changes

## What This Means for Your Projects

### Requirements Traceability

- Every code change can be linked to a requirement
- You can see exactly what was implemented when
- Changes to requirements can be tracked over time

### Project Visibility

- See real-time progress on features
- Understand what developers are working on
- Identify blockers and dependencies

### Better Estimates

- Historical data shows how long similar changes took
- Understand complexity by seeing how much code changed
- More accurate timelines for future projects

## Quick Example: Feature Development

**Traditional approach:**

1. BA writes requirement: "Users need login"
2. Developer works on it (BA doesn't see progress)
3. Week later: "Is login done?" "Almost..."
4. Another week: "Now it's done"

**With Git/GitHub:**

1. BA writes requirement in GitHub issue
2. Developer creates branch: "feature/user-login"
3. BA can see daily commits: "Add login form", "Connect to database", "Add password validation"
4. Developer opens pull request for review
5. BA can see exactly what was built and provide feedback
6. Feature is merged and goes live

## Next Steps

Understanding these basics helps you:

- Read developer updates more effectively
- Ask better questions about implementation
- Participate in project planning discussions
- Bridge the gap between business needs and technical solutions
