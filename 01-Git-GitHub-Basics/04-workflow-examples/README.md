```
Great work! I tested the feature and it works as expected. 
Few suggestions:

‚úÖ All acceptance criteria met
‚úÖ Email template looks professional
‚úÖ Security considerations handled well

üí¨ Minor feedback:
- Could we add a confirmation message after email is sent?
- "Password" field label could be "New Password" for clarity

Approved pending minor changes.
```

**Developer Review (Mike):**
```
Code looks good overall! Few technical suggestions:

‚úÖ Logic is sound
‚úÖ Error handling is comprehensive
‚úÖ Security best practices followed

üí¨ Code feedback:
- Consider adding rate limiting for reset requests
- Small typo in line 45 of auth.js
- Might want to add logging for security events

## üë• Team Collaboration Workflow

### Scenario: Multi-Developer Feature

#### The Situation
Building a user dashboard with multiple components:
- User profile section (Developer A)
- Activity timeline (Developer B)  
- Settings panel (Developer C)

#### Coordination Strategy

```bash
# Main coordination branch
git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard

# Each developer creates sub-branches
git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard-profile    # Developer A
git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard-timeline   # Developer B  
git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard-settings   # Developer C
```

#### Integration Process

```bash
# Developer A finishes first
git checkout feature/user-dashboard
git merge feature/user-dashboard-profile
git push origin feature/user-dashboard

# Developer B integrates their work
git checkout feature/user-dashboard
git pull origin feature/user-dashboard  # Get A's changes
git merge feature/user-dashboard-timeline
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin feature/user-dashboard

# Developer C does the same
git checkout feature/user-dashboard
git pull origin feature/user-dashboard  # Get A+B's changes
git merge feature/user-dashboard-settings
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin feature/user-dashboard

# Final integration testing
# Create PR from feature/user-dashboard to main
```

## üéØ GitHub Best Practices in Action

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/description     ‚Üí feature/user-dashboard
bugfix/description      ‚Üí bugfix/mobile-login
hotfix/description      ‚Üí hotfix/security-patch
release/version         ‚Üí release/v2.1.0
```

### Commit Message Standards
```
type(scope): description

Examples:
feat(auth): add forgot password functionality
fix(mobile): resolve login button touch events
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(css): fix button spacing on mobile
refactor(api): simplify user authentication logic
test(login): add unit tests for password reset
```

### PR Template
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# When git says there are conflicts
git status  # Shows conflicted files

# Edit files to resolve conflicts
# Look for:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> branch-name

# After resolving
git add resolved-file.js
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in user authentication"
```

### Accidentally Committed to Wrong Branch
```bash
# Move last commit to correct branch
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo commit, keep changes
git stash                 # Save changes temporarily
git checkout correct-branch
git stash pop            # Restore changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature to correct branch"
```

## üéØ Key Takeaways for BAs

1. **Issues are your friend** - Use them to track all requirements and bugs
2. **Pull Requests ensure quality** - Code is reviewed before going live
3. **Branches enable parallel work** - Multiple features can be developed simultaneously
4. **Tags mark important milestones** - Easy to find specific releases
5. **Good communication is crucial** - Clear descriptions and reviews save time
