## üìã Common BA Decision Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I choose between Material-UI and Tailwind CSS?**
A: Material-UI for business applications needing speed and consistency. Tailwind for branded applications needing design flexibility.

**Q: What if we need to change UI libraries later?**
A: Plan for component abstraction from the start. Budget 20-40% of original development cost for major library changes.

**Q: Should we consider building our own component library?**
A: Only if you have unique requirements that existing libraries can't meet and budget for $100,000+ investment.

**Q: How important is the size of the library's community?**
A: Critical for long-term success. Large communities mean better support, more examples, and easier hiring.

**Q: Can we use multiple UI libraries in the same application?**
A: Technically possible but not recommended. Creates inconsistency and increases bundle size and complexity.

**Q: What about licensing and legal considerations?**
A: Most UI libraries use MIT or similar permissive licenses. Always verify license compatibility with your business needs.
