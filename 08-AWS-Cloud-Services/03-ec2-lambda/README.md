# ‚ö° AWS EC2 & Lambda - BA Guide

## üéØ What Are EC2 and Lambda for Business Applications?

EC2 and Lambda represent two different approaches to running business applications in the cloud. Think of EC2 as **renting powerful computers in the cloud**, while Lambda is like **paying for work by the task**.

### **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

- **Virtual servers** you control completely
- Like having **dedicated office computers** but in the cloud
- **Always running** and ready for work
- You manage everything: operating system, software, security

### **AWS Lambda**

- **Functions that run only when needed**
- Like having **freelance specialists** you call for specific tasks
- **Pay per execution** - no cost when not running
- AWS manages everything: servers, scaling, maintenance

## üè¢ Real-World Business Applications

### **EC2 - Traditional Business Applications**

```markdown
Best For:

- Full business applications (CRM, ERP systems)
- Databases and data processing
- Legacy software migration
- Applications requiring constant availability

Business Examples:

- Customer portal running 24/7
- E-commerce website with shopping cart
- Business intelligence dashboard
- File sharing and collaboration platform

Business Benefits:

- Complete control over environment
- Predictable monthly costs
- Can run any software or database
- Easy migration from existing servers
```

### **Lambda - Task-Based Business Automation**

```markdown
Best For:

- Automated business processes
- API endpoints and microservices
- Image/document processing
- Scheduled business tasks

Business Examples:

- Process customer uploads (resize images, extract data)
- Send automated emails and notifications
- Generate reports on schedule
- Process payment transactions
- Backup and data synchronization

Business Benefits:

- Pay only for actual usage
- Automatic scaling for demand spikes
- No server management required
- Perfect for intermittent tasks
```

## üí∞ Cost Comparison for Business Planning

### **EC2 Cost Structure**

```markdown
Small Business Application:

- EC2 Instance (t3.medium): $30/month
- Storage (100GB): $10/month
- Data transfer: $9/month
- Total: ~$49/month for 24/7 availability

Medium Business Application:

- EC2 Instance (t3.large): $60/month
- Storage (500GB): $50/month
- Load balancing: $18/month
- Total: ~$128/month

Enterprise Application:

- Multiple instances: $500-2,000/month
- High availability setup: Additional 50%
- Total: $750-3,000/month
```

### **Lambda Cost Structure**

```markdown
Small Business Automation:

- 100,000 requests/month: $0.20
- Processing time: $2.00
- Total: ~$2.20/month

Medium Business Processing:

- 1 million requests/month: $2.00
- Image processing: $15.00
- Email automation: $5.00
- Total: ~$22/month

Enterprise Integration:

- Complex workflows: $100-500/month
- Still 70-80% cheaper than equivalent EC2
```

### **Cost Decision Matrix**

```markdown
Choose EC2 When:

- Application runs continuously (>50% of time)
- Need persistent data or sessions
- Require specific software configurations
- Predictable, steady workload

Choose Lambda When:

- Intermittent or event-driven tasks
- Processing spikes are unpredictable
- Want minimal operational overhead
- Cost optimization is priority
```

## üìä Business Application Architecture

### **EC2-Based Business Architecture**

```markdown
Traditional Business Application:
Frontend (React) ‚Üí Load Balancer ‚Üí EC2 Servers ‚Üí Database

Pros:

- Familiar architecture for IT teams
- Full control over environment
- Predictable performance
- Easy to migrate existing applications

Cons:

- Higher monthly costs
- Requires server management
- Need to plan for capacity
- Pay for idle time
```

### **Lambda-Based Business Architecture**

```markdown
Modern Serverless Application:
Frontend (React) ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda Functions ‚Üí Database

Pros:

- Pay only for actual usage
- Automatic scaling
- No server management
- Perfect for variable workloads

Cons:

- Learning curve for development team
- Some limitations on execution time
- Cold start delays for infrequent functions
```

### **Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**

```markdown
Best of Both Worlds:

- Core application: EC2 for stability
- Background tasks: Lambda for efficiency
- File processing: Lambda for cost savings
- Scheduled jobs: Lambda for automation

Business Benefits:

- Optimize costs where possible
- Maintain stability where needed
- Gradual migration path
- Team skill development
```

## üéØ What BAs Should Know

### **Project Planning Considerations**

```markdown
EC2 Planning:

- Development time: Similar to traditional servers
- Team skills: Standard web development
- Timeline: 8-16 weeks for full application
- Ongoing costs: Predictable monthly fees

Lambda Planning:

- Development time: 20-30% longer initially
- Team skills: Serverless development training needed
- Timeline: 10-20 weeks for full migration
- Ongoing costs: Variable, usually lower
```

### **Business Impact Assessment**

```markdown
Performance Considerations:

- EC2: Consistent performance, always ready
- Lambda: 0-3 second cold start for new functions

Scalability:

- EC2: Manual scaling, capacity planning required
- Lambda: Automatic scaling, handles traffic spikes

Maintenance:

- EC2: OS updates, security patches, monitoring
- Lambda: AWS handles all infrastructure maintenance
```

## üìã Common BA Questions & Answers

**Q: Which is better for our e-commerce site?**
A: EC2 for the main site (24/7 availability), Lambda for order processing and email automation.

**Q: How do we estimate Lambda costs?**
A: Start with pilot project, monitor usage patterns, typically 60-80% cost savings vs EC2.

**Q: Can we migrate gradually from EC2 to Lambda?**
A: Yes, perfect hybrid approach: keep core app on EC2, move background tasks to Lambda first.

**Q: What about data security and compliance?**
A: Both EC2 and Lambda support enterprise security and compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA).

**Q: How does this affect our development timeline?**
A: EC2: Faster initial development. Lambda: Longer learning curve but faster iterations later.
