# React Native Basics - Business Analyst's Guide

## Executive Summary

React Native is a cross-platform mobile development framework that allows businesses to build native mobile apps using JavaScript/TypeScript. Think of it as the "write once, deploy everywhere" solution for mobile development - similar to how a multinational company can use standardized processes across different countries while adapting to local regulations.

### Business Value Proposition

- **Cost Reduction**: 60-70% reduction in development costs compared to building separate native apps
- **Time to Market**: 40-50% faster delivery to both iOS and Android markets
- **Resource Efficiency**: One development team instead of separate iOS and Android teams
- **Competitive Advantage**: Simultaneous platform launches and feature parity

## Common Business Analyst Questions & Answers

### Q1: "How does React Native compare to native development for user experience?"

**A**: React Native delivers 90-95% of native performance for typical business applications. Users cannot distinguish between React Native and native apps in most use cases. Examples include Instagram, Facebook Marketplace, and Walmart's app.

### Q2: "What's the risk if Facebook discontinues React Native?"

**A**: Low risk - React Native is open source with massive community adoption. Even if Facebook withdrew support, the community would continue development. Additionally, code can be migrated to other frameworks or native development.

### Q3: "How quickly can we pivot between iOS and Android feature releases?"

**A**: React Native enables simultaneous releases. Feature development for both platforms happens in parallel, allowing coordinated marketing campaigns and consistent user experience across platforms.

### Q4: "What's the learning curve for our existing web development team?"

**A**: Moderate learning curve (4-6 weeks). Developers familiar with React can transition to React Native efficiently. The concepts are similar, with mobile-specific UI components and device APIs being the main differences.

### Q5: "How does maintenance cost compare to native apps?"

**A**: 30-40% lower maintenance costs due to shared codebase. Bug fixes and feature updates apply to both platforms simultaneously, reducing QA testing time and deployment complexity.
