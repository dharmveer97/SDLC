# Mobile vs Web Development - Business Analyst's Strategic Guide

## Executive Summary

The mobile vs web decision is like choosing between opening a physical storefront (mobile app) versus an e-commerce website. Each serves different customer needs, requires different investments, and offers distinct advantages. This strategic choice fundamentally impacts user experience, development costs, market reach, and long-term business scalability.

### Business Decision Framework

Mobile apps excel in engagement and device integration, while web applications provide broader accessibility and easier updates. The optimal strategy often involves both channels, with clear understanding of when and why each serves specific business objectives.

## Common Business Analyst Questions & Answers

### Q1: "Should we build a mobile app or responsive website first?"

**A**: Start with responsive web if your primary goal is broad market reach and content discovery. Start with mobile app if you need device integration, offline capability, or high user engagement. Consider your user acquisition strategy and primary business model.

### Q2: "How do conversion rates compare between mobile apps and mobile web?"

**A**: Mobile apps typically see 3x higher conversion rates for transactional activities, but mobile web reaches 10x more users initially. The total conversion volume often favors the channel that aligns with your customer acquisition strategy.

### Q3: "What's the long-term maintenance cost difference?"

**A**: Web applications require 20-30% less maintenance cost due to single deployment target and easier updates. Mobile apps require separate maintenance for iOS and Android, plus app store approval processes for updates.

### Q4: "How do we measure success differently for mobile vs web?"

**A**: Mobile apps focus on engagement metrics (session length, retention, in-app actions), while web applications emphasize reach metrics (traffic, SEO rankings, conversion funnels). Success metrics should align with your business model and customer journey.

### Q5: "Can we start with one approach and migrate to the other later?"

**A**: Yes, but plan the architecture accordingly. Many successful businesses start with web applications and add mobile apps as they scale. The reverse is more challenging due to SEO and content discoverability requirements.

## Implementation Strategy for Business Teams

### Hybrid Approach: Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

```
Business Benefits:
- 70% mobile app functionality with web accessibility
- Single development effort for cross-platform reach
- App-like user experience without app store dependency
- Offline capability and push notifications
- Lower development and maintenance costs

Implementation Considerations:
- iOS limitations for PWA features
- Performance trade-offs vs native apps
- Limited device integration capabilities
- User education required for "install" process
```

### Decision Matrix Framework

```
Choose Mobile App When:
- User engagement > 5 sessions per week
- Device features essential to core functionality
- Push notifications critical for business model
- Offline usage represents >20% of use cases
- In-app purchase revenue model

Choose Web Application When:
- SEO traffic represents >40% of user acquisition

- Cross-device usage patterns important
- Rapid iteration and A/B testing required
- Development budget constraints exist

Choose Both When:
- Large user base justifies dual investment
