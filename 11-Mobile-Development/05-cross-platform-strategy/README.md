## Common Business Analyst Questions & Answers

### Q1: "How do we decide between React Native, Flutter, and Xamarin for our business needs?"

**A**: React Native if you have web developers and need fast market entry. Flutter if performance and consistent UI are critical with budget for Dart training. Xamarin if you're Microsoft-centric and need enterprise integration. Consider team skills, performance requirements, and long-term strategy.

### Q2: "What's the realistic code sharing percentage we can achieve?"

**A**: Expect 70-85% code sharing for business logic, with 15-30% platform-specific code for UI optimization, native integrations, and performance tuning. Higher sharing is possible but may compromise user experience quality.

### Q3: "How do we maintain competitive user experience with cross-platform development?"

**A**: Invest 20-30% of development time in platform-specific optimizations. Use native UI components where possible, implement platform-specific user flows, and continuously benchmark against native competitors. User experience quality depends on optimization investment.

### Q4: "What's the long-term business risk of cross-platform dependency?"

**A**: Framework abandonment risk is low for major platforms (React Native, Flutter) due to large ecosystems. Mitigation strategies include maintaining platform expertise, contributing to open source communities, and planning migration paths if needed.

### Q5: "How do we measure success of our cross-platform strategy?"

**A**: Track development velocity (features per sprint), cost per platform, user experience metrics (ratings, retention), performance benchmarks, and business outcomes (revenue, user growth). Compare against native development baselines and industry benchmarks.
