# üèóÔ∏è Building React App - BA Guide

## üéØ What Does "Building a React App" Mean?

Building a React app means creating a **complete business application** using React components and modern tools. It's like **constructing a digital business** - from foundation to fully operational system.

Think of it as:

- **Digital construction project** - Building from blueprint to move-in ready
- **Business assembly** - Combining components into working system
