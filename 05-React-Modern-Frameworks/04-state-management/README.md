# üß† State Management - BA Guide

## üéØ What Is State Management?

State management is like the **memory and coordination system** for web applications. It keeps track of all information and ensures different parts of the application stay synchronized and consistent.

Think of it as:

- **Central nervous system** - Coordinates all parts of the application
- **Shared memory** - Information accessible to all components
- **Traffic controller** - Manages information flow between features
- **Business brain** - Remembers user data, preferences, and workflows

## üè¢ Real-World Business Analogy

**Large Corporation Communication:**

- **Without coordination** - Departments work in isolation, inconsistent information
- **With coordination** - Central communication system, everyone has same information

**Application Without State Management:**

- Shopping cart forgets items when navigating
- User login status inconsistent across pages
- Forms lose data when switching sections
- Dashboard shows outdated information

**Application With State Management:**

- Consistent user experience across all features
- Real-time updates throughout application
- Preserved user work and preferences
- Synchronized business data

## üéØ Critical Business Applications

## üéØ What BAs Should Include in Requirements

### State-Related Requirements

```markdown
‚úÖ Good Requirements:
